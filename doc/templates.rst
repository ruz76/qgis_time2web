Creating templates
------------------

A template for creating an OL3 map is basically a page with a set of placeholders that will be replaced when the plugin creates the map.

To be available, a template must be saved in the ``templates``folder in the folder where you have installed the plugin (usually ``~/.qgis2/python/plugins/ol3).

Check the ``basic.html`Ã¬n the ``templates`` folder file to see a valid template and how placeholders are used.
