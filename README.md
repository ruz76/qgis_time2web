<h1>time2web</h1>
<p>QGIS plugin to export your project to an OpenLayers 3 or Leaflet webmap. No
server-side software required. For Leaflet is added posibility to add time axis and select columns with datetime information.</p>

<a href="http://gisak.vsb.cz/ruzicka/time/">Sample output</a>

<h2>Installation</h2>
<ul>
    <li>In QGIS, select <code>Plugins > Manage and Install Plugins...</code></li>
</ul>
<p>or:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Download and unzip to your QGIS plugins directory</li>
</ul>

<h2>Usage</h2>
<p>Prepare your map as far as possible in QGIS, as you want it to appear in
your webmap. Specific tasks you can carry out to improve your webmap include:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>Set your project title, and background and highlight colours in 
    <code>Project > Project Properties...</code></li>
    <li>Give your layers human-friendly names in the <code>Layers Panel</code>
    </li>
    <li>Give your layer columns human friendly names via <code>Layer >
    Properties > Fields > Alias</code></li>
</ul>
<p>Run time2web from the Web menu, or via its icon. If required, choose a
basemap from the list below the preview pane, and click "Update preview".
CTRL/CMD-click for multiple basemaps.</p>
<p>The top-left pane lets you set options for each layer in your map. The
bottom-left pane sets overall options. All options are written to your QGIS
project, so save your proejct if you want to keep these settings.</p>

<h2>Current limitations</h2>
<p>QGIS, OpenLayers 3, and Leaflet are all different mapping technologies.
This means that their respective functionality differs in many ways. time2web
does its best to interpret a QGIS project and to export HTML, Javascript, and
CSS to create a web map as close to the QGIS project as possible.</p>
<p>However, many elements of a QGIS project cannot be reproduced, and many are
only possible in <em>either</em> OpenLayers 3 <em>or</em> Leaflet. time2web
tries its best to produce a publish-ready map, but you can always manually edit
the output code to achieve what time2web cannot.</p>
<ul>
    <li>no rule-based rendering</li>
    <li>SVG point markers sometimes do not appear in the preview
        pane, but work when the map is exported</li>
    <li>in OL3 maps, only single rendered points cluster, not categorized
        or graduated</li>
    <li>rasters are exported unstyled</li>
    <li>line style (dashed/dotted) does not appear in OL3 preview, but works in
        export</li>
    <li>Leaflet cannot label lines and polygons, only points</li>
    <li>OL3 cannot use time axis</li>
    <li>Time cannot be used with categorised layers</li>
</ul>

<h3>Layer options</h3>
<dl>
    <dt>Info popup content</dt>
        <dd>Select which fields will appear in popups when features are clicked
        </dd> 
    <dt>Time from</dt>
        <dd>Field with datetime information as integer value in form yyyymmddhhiiss. Short form of datetime is possible as well fopr example just year: 2016.
        </dd> 
    <dt>Time to</dt>
        <dd>Field with datetime information as integer value in form yyyymmddhhiiss. Short form of datetime is possible as well fopr example just year: 2016.
        </dd> 
    <dt>Visible</dt>
        <dd>Select whether the layer will be visible on map load. This only
            determines visibility - the layer will be loaded regardless of this
            setting</dd> 
    <dt>Encode to JSON</dt>
        <dd>If unchecked, WFS layers will remain remote WFS layers in the
            webmap. If checked, the layer will be written to a local GeoJSON
            file</dd>
    <dt>Cluster</dt>
        <dd>Cluster point features</dd>
</dl>

<h3>General options</h3>

<h4>Time axis</h4>

<h4>Data export</h4>
<dl>
    <dt>Delete unused fields</dt>
        <dd>If not all fields are selected in "Info popup content", remove the

            size</dd>

        <dd>The folder where the webmap will be saved</dd> 
    <dt>Mapping library location</dt>
